# Product-Category-Classification-using-AIML-models
This project tackles the challenge of classifying products into a two-level hierarchical category structure, inspired by real-world e-commerce taxonomies (like Etsy). Each product is assigned both a top-level category (e.g., "Clothing", "Home Decor") and a bottom-level category (e.g., "Menâ€™s Hoodies", "Wall Art").
